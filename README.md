# Stakefish Project

Task: Build an application that will serve as a directory of cryptocurrency exchanges using the Coingeck API. The main page should have 10 items that are paginated. Each exchange will contain information like name, country, URL, logo, and trust rank. When a user clicks on one of the exchanges then it will bring them to a separate page that will contain additional information like year of establishment, social media links, and description.
